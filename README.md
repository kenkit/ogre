# OGRE 2.1+CEGUI PREBUILT SDK
## Summary
**OGRE 2.1+CEGUI+(OGRE_DEPS+CEGUI_DEPS) PREBUILT SDK**
(Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine Prebuilt SDK) 
This is a prebuilt sdk of both ogre and cegui.It contains the necessary libs required to use Ogre+Cegui in your application. 
Builds are generated automatically and sourced from the respective repos.
The builds are also from the latest commits available.

I'm trying to avoid having to build both sdk locally as it's too huge and would take a long time to finish building.
Also not to forget the space+download data required to build it is alot.
So if you think this will be usefull there is a star icon somwewhere up there.

## What is not working
Currently the sample browser from cegui is failing to build so I have disabled, but am working on fixing this.
